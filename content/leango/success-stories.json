      "company": "Terrasmart",
      "industry": "Manufacturing",
      "challenge": "Delivery reliability for project materials to customer sites needed significant improvement, with supply chain decisions lacking the data-driven visibility to predict on-time performance.",
      "solution": "LeanGo worked with Francisco Henriquez (VP Operations), Mick Kirby West (Supply Chain Manager), and their team to co-create and implement an MRP dashboard that predicts on-time delivery success and drives smarter inventory and supply decisions.",
      "results": [
        "30%+ increase in delivery reliability",
        "20%+ reduction in inventory",
        "Data-driven supply chain decisions",
        "Real-time visibility into on-time performance"

      "quote": "LeanGo integrated with our team and built a tool we actually use every day. The dashboard changed how we make supply chain decisions - we went from reacting to predicting.",

      "company": "Miller Valentine",
      "industry": "Manufacturing",
      "challenge": "Multiple important improvement initiatives needed to move faster, but the team lacked a structured system to accelerate and track progress across them all.",
      "solution": "LeanGo worked with Dean Vukovic (VP Technology), Peggy Scott (Sprint Champion), and their team to co-create and implement an improvement sprint system that drives accountability and pace across initiatives.",
      "results": [
        "100+ improvement actions completed in first quarter",
        "Structured sprint cadence adopted across teams",
        "Clear ownership and accountability for every action",
        "Visible progress across all key initiatives"

      "solution": "LeanGo worked with Steve Schmitt (President), Pete Grill (Plant Manager), and their team to co-create a predictive wear part replacement system and implemented a centralized computerized maintenance management system for preventive maintenance and repair requests.",
