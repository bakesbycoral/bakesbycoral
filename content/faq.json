      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What does LeanGo do?",
          "answer": "LeanGo is an improvement support team. We integrate into your existing teams and work on your goals, projects, priorities, problems, and needs. We bring expertise in CI, Lean, Six Sigma, and structured problem solving. We bring horsepower as an extension of your team. And we build sustainable systems that are co-created with your people, transferred, and supported."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do we get started?",
          "answer": "Schedule a free session. We'll learn about your challenges, walk through how we work, and figure out if we're a good fit. No commitment required."
        },
        {
          "question": "What industries do you work with?",
          "answer": "Our core experience is in manufacturing and construction, but Lean principles apply to any process-driven organization. We've worked with teams in logistics, healthcare, and professional services."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does a typical engagement last?",
          "answer": "It depends on the scope. Some projects are a few weeks, others are ongoing partnerships. We tailor the timeline to your goals and always focus on building your team's capability so you don't need us forever."
        },
        {
          "question": "What makes LeanGo different from other consultants?",
          "answer": "We integrate into your team - we don't operate as outside consultants. We work inside your communication structures, meetings, and improvement systems. Our role is flexible - sometimes we're hands-on support, sometimes we're system enablers, developers, coaches, or trainers. Everything we build is co-created, transferred, and supported."
        }

    {
      "title": "How We Work",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What do you mean by 'integrate into your team'?",
          "answer": "We join your existing communication structures, meetings, and improvement systems. No parallel workstreams - we work inside your operation, onsite as needed and remote for efficiency."
        },
        {
          "question": "What do you bring to an engagement?",
          "answer": "Three things: Expertise - deep knowledge in CI, Lean, Six Sigma, and structured problem solving. Horsepower - we become an extension of your team focused entirely on driving improvements. Sustainable systems - co-created with your people, transferred to your team, and supported until they stick."
        },
        {
          "question": "What capabilities do you add?",
          "answer": "Improvement management and leadership to keep projects moving. Analytics co-creation and scalability so you see what matters. Application development and automation to eliminate friction. And hands-on training and coaching for your people."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you work on-site or remotely?",
          "answer": "Both. We're on the floor when it matters - building solutions with your people. We work remotely when it makes sense - keeping things moving without adding overhead. The mix depends on what your team needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you do the improvement work for us?",
          "answer": "We work with your team, not instead of them. Our goal is to build your internal capability so improvements continue long after we leave. Your people sustain and improve the system."
        }
      ]

    {
      "title": "Our Approach",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is your approach to improvements?",
          "answer": "We start with assessments to understand where you are. Then we prioritize what matters most. From there it's improvement planning and execution, training so your people grow, and sustainment systems so improvements last. We use the right tools to support the right solution."
        },
        {
          "question": "What tools do you use?",
          "answer": "We don't lead with tools - we lead with your goals, problems, and priorities. Then we pull from a proven set: Lean problem solving, apps and automation, analytics and dashboards, and training and coaching. The combination depends on what your team actually needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is Lean problem solving?",
          "answer": "Structured methods to fix problems permanently. Instead of guessing or firefighting, your team learns to define problems clearly, find root causes, and implement changes that stick. We use approaches like A3 Thinking, 5 Whys, Process Mapping, and PDCA Cycles."
        },
        {
          "question": "What kind of apps do you build?",
          "answer": "Simple, purpose-built apps created with your team that fit your workflow and fill the gaps. Think scrap and downtime logging, standard work checklists, skill tracking systems, tier meeting boards, and maintenance or quality workflows. We don't sell off-the-shelf software - we build what you actually need."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does your analytics work look like?",
          "answer": "We co-create dashboards with your people so the data drives decisions, not just displays numbers. Your team helps build them, which means they actually get used. The goal is better daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly decisions."
        }

    {
      "title": "Training & Certification",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What training do you offer?",
          "answer": "We train team leads, supervisors, operators, quality and maintenance techs, and future leaders. Our training focuses on problem solving, standard work, communication, daily management routines, using digital tools confidently, and running effective meetings. When your people grow, performance grows."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the Lean Lego Simulation?",
          "answer": "A hands-on training experience where teams build products using LEGO, identify waste, and implement improvements in real time. It's the fastest way to help people understand Lean concepts because they experience them firsthand."
        },
        {
          "question": "What certifications do you offer?",
          "answer": "We offer a Lean Lego Simulation (Yellow Belt) for anyone new to Lean, Lean Six Sigma Green Belt for operations and quality professionals looking to upgrade their skills, and Lean Practitioner certification for CI professionals and production leaders."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is training done on-site or virtual?",
          "answer": "Both. We offer in-person, virtual, and hybrid options. For the Lean Lego Simulation, we can come to you or you can license a kit to run it in-house."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can we buy the Lego Simulation kit?",
          "answer": "Yes. We offer Train-the-Trainer and DIY kit options so your team can run the simulation on your own schedule. Ongoing support is included with every license."

        {
          "question": "Where are you located?",
          "answer": "We're based in Cincinnati, OH, but we work with teams across the country. Most engagements combine on-site visits with remote support."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does it cost?",
          "answer": "Every engagement is different. We'll scope the work together during your free session and provide transparent pricing before anything starts."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do we need special software or licenses?",
          "answer": "We leverage the digital tools your organization already has in place. We work with what you have to fill in the workflow gaps."
